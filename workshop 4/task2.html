        <img src="./Subway-surfers.jpg" alt="subway.jpg">
        <p>Subway Surfers is an endless runner video game. The game starts by tapping the touchscreen, while Jake (the game's starter character) or any other character sprays graffiti on a subway, and gets caught in the act by the inspector and his dog, who starts chasing the character. While running, the player can swipe up, down, left, or right to avoid crashing into oncoming obstacles especially moving subways, poles, tunnel walls and barriers. By swiping rapidly as speed increases, more points can be acquired.</p>
